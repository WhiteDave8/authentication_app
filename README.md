# authentication_app (Flutter Web)

Animated, glassmorphic sign-in/sign-up with Email + Google + Apple wiring (Firebase-ready).

## One-time setup (phone-friendly)
1. Create a new GitHub repo named `authentication_app`.
2. Upload the **contents** of this folder to the repo root.
3. Ensure your default branch is `main`.
4. Wait for the GitHub Action to finish.
5. In Repo → Settings → Pages → set Source to `Deploy from a branch`, then select the `gh-pages` branch.

Your app will be live at GitHub Pages (URL shown on the Pages screen).

> OAuth buttons will render; to actually sign in on the web, later add Firebase Hosting + OAuth redirect URIs.
